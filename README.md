# World Cup 2018 Data Analysis

In this project, I did an in-depth analysis and visualization on the FIFA18 dataset. The dataset is collected at this [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/amanthedorkknight/fifa18-all-player-statistics). The goal is to predict the best possible international squad lineups for these 10 teams: France, Germany, Spain, England, Brazil, Argentina, Belgium, Portugal, Uruguay, and Croatia at the 2018 World Cup this summer in Russia.
